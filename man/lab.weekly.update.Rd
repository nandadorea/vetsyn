\description{
This dataset is similar to "lab.weekly", but only the last month
of events are included, plus one new week, in order to reflect the update of 
information week by week, which constitutes a common scenario when implementing
syndromic surveillance. The actual 
dates have been altered and the animal species is not given, in order to 
comply with the institute's privacy policies. Further, all test information
has been removed and only the final syndromic classification is given. Only
the minimal nuber of columns needed to demonstrate the functionality of the package
have been kept. These are: a column with the syndromic classification, a column 
specifying the date of submission, and one or multiple columns used to 
identify unique cases. In this particular dataset a case is defined as a unique 
combination of date, herdID and submissionID. HerdID and SubmissionID in this 
dataset have been altered to ensure privacy.
